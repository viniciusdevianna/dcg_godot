This is a personal project of a card game heavily based on the card minigame of Digimon that is in Digimon World 3 for the PSX.

## :bookmark: Introduction

I'm a huge fan of monster collecting games (Pok√©mon, Digimon and everything in between) and I also like the concept of digital card games a lot.
A long time ago, in early 2000s, I got addicted to a very fun RPG called Digimon World 3 (PSX era!).
The thing about good old JRPGs is that they used to be filled with mini games, and DW3 was no different. There was a simple but fully flashed card game inside DW3 and, man, did I have fun playing this thing.
Now I'm a developer and a lot interested in learning to make games, so I decided to try to recreate the card minigame I loved back then and tweak it a little to make it a fun full game.

I'm following the awesome tutorial of [@godotgamelab](https://www.youtube.com/@godotgamelab) to learn the basics of creating a card game in godot.

As it's my first time with Godot, I'm also refering a lot to basic GDScript tutorials such as the ones provided by [@GodotTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@GodotTutorials).
